Hiding an animal\\n    of this size is difficult: if you use a lot of space, it is\\n    obvious that you are hiding something from your friends. Hence,\\n    you want to use as little space as possible to hide the\\n    kangaroo.\\nWhen the kangaroo was placed against the wall, you took a\\n    black and white picture of the animal. Looking around in the\\n    house, the only tools you found to hide the kangaroo with were\\n    empty tin cans. The dimensions of the tin cans correspond with\\n    $2 \\\\times 2$ pixels in the\\n    picture and these cans cannot overlap. So, you can make a\\n    cangaroo and if someone asks why you have cans in the\\n    shape of a kangaroo, you simply say it is a bad joke of\\n    yours.\\nThe position of each can has to exactly correspond to a\\n    block of $2\\\\times 2$\\n    pixels in the picture, and they cannot be shifted or rotated to\\n    only partially cover some pixels. Furthermore, cans cannot\\n    float in the air, so every can has to be supported either by\\n    the floor, which is just below the bottom row of the picture,\\n    or by another can, for which at least one of the left and right\\n    half must directly rest on another can. The structure does not\\n    otherwise need to be balanced.\\nWhat is the minimum number of cans needed to hide the\\n    kangaroo?\\n\",\n          \"You have sent a robot out into the forest, and it has gotten\\n    lost. It has a sensor that will detect all the trees around\\n    itself regardless of any occlusions, but unfortunately in this\\n    forest, all trees look alike. You do have a map of all trees in\\n    the forest, represented as $(x,y)$ points. Conveniently, since\\n    this used to be a tree farm, all trees are at integer\\n    coordinates, though not all coordinates are occupied. The\\n    robot\\u2019s sensor tells you the $x$ and $y$ distance to each tree within\\n    range, relative to the front of the robot. However, the robot\\n    is heading in an unknown direction relative to the map, so each\\n    sensor reading is given as a tuple of (distance to the right of\\n    the robot, distance forward of the robot) and either value can\\n    be negative since the robot can sense in all directions.\\n    Helpfully, the robot will always place itself at integer\\n    coordinates and aligned to the positive or negative\\n    $x$ or $y$ axis, and will never be at the\\n    same location as a tree. Can you find out where the robot\\n    is?\\n\",\n          \"Method ringing is used to ring bells in churches,\\n    particularly in England.

Therefore,\\n    the position of each bell can change by at most one between two\\n    consecutive rows.\\nIn Figure\\u00a01, you can see the pattern of a non-ideal\\n    performance, where bells only change position by at most\\n    one.\\nGiven $n$, the number\\n    of bells, output an ideal performance.

Hiding an animal\\n    of this size is difficult: if you use a lot of space, it is\\n    obvious that you are hiding something from your friends. Hence,\\n    you want to use as little space as possible to hide the\\n    kangaroo.\\nWhen the kangaroo was placed against the wall, you took a\\n    black and white picture of the animal. Looking around in the\\n    house, the only tools you found to hide the kangaroo with were\\n    empty tin cans. The dimensions of the tin cans correspond with\\n    $2 \\\\times 2$ pixels in the\\n    picture and these cans cannot overlap. So, you can make a\\n    cangaroo and if someone asks why you have cans in the\\n    shape of a kangaroo, you simply say it is a bad joke of\\n    yours.\\nThe position of each can has to exactly correspond to a\\n    block of $2\\\\times 2$\\n    pixels in the picture, and they cannot be shifted or rotated to\\n    only partially cover some pixels. Furthermore, cans cannot\\n    float in the air, so every can has to be supported either by\\n    the floor, which is just below the bottom row of the picture,\\n    or by another can, for which at least one of the left and right\\n    half must directly rest on another can. The structure does not\\n    otherwise need to be balanced.\\nWhat is the minimum number of cans needed to hide the\\n    kangaroo?\\n\",\n          \"You have sent a robot out into the forest, and it has gotten\\n    lost. It has a sensor that will detect all the trees around\\n    itself regardless of any occlusions, but unfortunately in this\\n    forest, all trees look alike. You do have a map of all trees in\\n    the forest, represented as $(x,y)$ points. Conveniently, since\\n    this used to be a tree farm, all trees are at integer\\n    coordinates, though not all coordinates are occupied. The\\n    robot\\u2019s sensor tells you the $x$ and $y$ distance to each tree within\\n    range, relative to the front of the robot. However, the robot\\n    is heading in an unknown direction relative to the map, so each\\n    sensor reading is given as a tuple of (distance to the right of\\n    the robot, distance forward of the robot) and either value can\\n    be negative since the robot can sense in all directions.\\n    Helpfully, the robot will always place itself at integer\\n    coordinates and aligned to the positive or negative\\n    $x$ or $y$ axis, and will never be at the\\n    same location as a tree. Can you find out where the robot\\n    is?\\n\",\n          \"Method ringing is used to ring bells in churches,\\n    particularly in England. Suppose there are $6$ bells that have $6$ different pitches. We assign the\\n    number $1$ to the bell\\n    highest in pitch, $2$ to\\n    the second highest, and so on. When the $6$ bells are rung in some order\\u2014each\\n    of them exactly once\\u2014it is called a row. For example,\\n    $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ and\\n    $6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5$ are two\\n    different rows.\\nAn ideal performance contains all possible rows,\\n    each played exactly once. Unfortunately, the laws of physics\\n    place a limitation on any two consecutive rows; when a bell is\\n    rung, it has considerable inertia and the ringer has only a\\n    limited ability to accelerate or retard its cycle. Therefore,\\n    the position of each bell can change by at most one between two\\n    consecutive rows.\\nIn Figure\\u00a01, you can see the pattern of a non-ideal\\n    performance, where bells only change position by at most\\n    one.\\nGiven $n$, the number\\n    of bells, output an ideal performance. All possible rows must\\n    be present exactly once, and the first row should be\\n    $1, 2, \\\\dots , n$.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"input_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3760,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"There will be a single test case in the input.

Hiding an animal\\n    of this size is difficult: if you use a lot of space, it is\\n    obvious that you are hiding something from your friends. Hence,\\n    you want to use as little space as possible to hide the\\n    kangaroo.\\nWhen the kangaroo was placed against the wall, you took a\\n    black and white picture of the animal. Looking around in the\\n    house, the only tools you found to hide the kangaroo with were\\n    empty tin cans. The dimensions of the tin cans correspond with\\n    $2 \\\\times 2$ pixels in the\\n    picture and these cans cannot overlap. So, you can make a\\n    cangaroo and if someone asks why you have cans in the\\n    shape of a kangaroo, you simply say it is a bad joke of\\n    yours.\\nThe position of each can has to exactly correspond to a\\n    block of $2\\\\times 2$\\n    pixels in the picture, and they cannot be shifted or rotated to\\n    only partially cover some pixels. Furthermore, cans cannot\\n    float in the air, so every can has to be supported either by\\n    the floor, which is just below the bottom row of the picture,\\n    or by another can, for which at least one of the left and right\\n    half must directly rest on another can. The structure does not\\n    otherwise need to be balanced.\\nWhat is the minimum number of cans needed to hide the\\n    kangaroo?\\n\",\n          \"You have sent a robot out into the forest, and it has gotten\\n    lost. It has a sensor that will detect all the trees around\\n    itself regardless of any occlusions, but unfortunately in this\\n    forest, all trees look alike. You do have a map of all trees in\\n    the forest, represented as $(x,y)$ points. Conveniently, since\\n    this used to be a tree farm, all trees are at integer\\n    coordinates, though not all coordinates are occupied. The\\n    robot\\u2019s sensor tells you the $x$ and $y$ distance to each tree within\\n    range, relative to the front of the robot. However, the robot\\n    is heading in an unknown direction relative to the map, so each\\n    sensor reading is given as a tuple of (distance to the right of\\n    the robot, distance forward of the robot) and either value can\\n    be negative since the robot can sense in all directions.\\n    Helpfully, the robot will always place itself at integer\\n    coordinates and aligned to the positive or negative\\n    $x$ or $y$ axis, and will never be at the\\n    same location as a tree. Can you find out where the robot\\n    is?\\n\",\n          \"Method ringing is used to ring bells in churches,\\n    particularly in England.

when a bell is rung, it has considerable inertia and the ringer has only a limited ability to accelerate or retard its cycle. therefore, the position of each bell can change by at most one between two consecutive rows. in figure 1, you can see the pattern of a non-ideal performance, where bells only change position by at most one. given $n$, the number of bells, output an ideal performance. all possible rows must be present exactly once, and the first row should be $1, 2, \\\\dots , n$.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"input_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3760,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"there will be a single test case in the input. this test case will begin with a single line with four integers:\",\n          \"the input consists of a single data set. this data set starts with a line containing the number of rows in the input grid $r$, ($1 \\\\le r \\\\le 7$), and the number of columns in the input grid $c$, ($1 \\\\le c \\\\le 7$), separated by spaces. the next $r$ lines contain a representation of the incomplete input grid, one row per line. each row has $c$ characters, representing the digits in each cell. the value in each cell is represented by either the digit already in that cell or a \\u2018-\\u2019 for an initially empty cell.\",\n          \"the first line contains a single integer $1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 10^5$, the number of cards in the deck.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3904,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"output an integer, the maximum number of cookies you could have earned.\",\n          \"output one line containing a single string: \\u201cyes\\u201d if it is possible to conquer gym leader $k$, \\u201cno\\u201d otherwise.\",\n          \"output a single line containing a floating point number, $d$, the largest minimum distance between a red and a blue egg that can be achieved. you are required to output $d$ with absolute precision $10^{-6}$, i.e. with at least $6$ decimal places.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"problem_class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hard\",\n          \"medium\",\n          \"easy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"problem_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.177928056617497,\n        \"min\": 1.1,\n        \"max\": 9.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2.1,\n          9.7,\n          7.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4111,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://open.kattis.com/problems/prospecting\",\n          \"https://open.kattis.com/problems/icefloes\",\n          \"https://open.kattis.com/problems/balltricks\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

when a bell is rung, it has considerable inertia and the ringer has only a limited ability to accelerate or retard its cycle. therefore, the position of each bell can change by at most one between two consecutive rows. in figure 1, you can see the pattern of a non-ideal performance, where bells only change position by at most one. given $n$, the number of bells, output an ideal performance. all possible rows must be present exactly once, and the first row should be $1, 2, \\\\dots , n$.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"input_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3760,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"there will be a single test case in the input. this test case will begin with a single line with four integers:\",\n          \"the input consists of a single data set. this data set starts with a line containing the number of rows in the input grid $r$, ($1 \\\\le r \\\\le 7$), and the number of columns in the input grid $c$, ($1 \\\\le c \\\\le 7$), separated by spaces. the next $r$ lines contain a representation of the incomplete input grid, one row per line. each row has $c$ characters, representing the digits in each cell. the value in each cell is represented by either the digit already in that cell or a \\u2018-\\u2019 for an initially empty cell.\",\n          \"the first line contains a single integer $1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 10^5$, the number of cards in the deck.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3904,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"output an integer, the maximum number of cookies you could have earned.\",\n          \"output one line containing a single string: \\u201cyes\\u201d if it is possible to conquer gym leader $k$, \\u201cno\\u201d otherwise.\",\n          \"output a single line containing a floating point number, $d$, the largest minimum distance between a red and a blue egg that can be achieved. you are required to output $d$ with absolute precision $10^{-6}$, i.e. with at least $6$ decimal places.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"problem_class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hard\",\n          \"medium\",\n          \"easy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"problem_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.177928056617497,\n        \"min\": 1.1,\n        \"max\": 9.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2.1,\n          9.7,\n          7.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4111,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://open.kattis.com/problems/prospecting\",\n          \"https://open.kattis.com/problems/icefloes\",\n          \"https://open.kattis.com/problems/balltricks\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4111,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"prospecting prospectin\\u2019 pete has a lead on a new titanium mine, and needs your help pitching a mining operation to investors. the mine can be represented as a tree: the mine entrance is the root of the tree, other tree nodes are pockets of underground titanium ore, and the tree edges are potential tunnels pete can dig between two pockets (or between the mine entrance and one pocket, for edges adjacent to the root node). the tunnel connecting the $i$-th ore pocket to its parent has a length of $y_ i$ feet. one of the tree leaves contains the motherlode, and each other ore pocket contains $x_ i$ dollars worth of ore. pete begins at the mine entrance, and his goal is to reach the motherlode. obviously, pete cannot travel to pocket $i$ until all $y_ i$ feet of dirt in the tunnel leading to it has been removed. but once a tunnel has been completely excavated, pete can travel that tunnel, in both directions, as many times as he wants. pete explores the mines by repeatedly performing the following steps, in order: pete chooses a tunnel that he can reach from his current location, and that has not yet been fully excavated. pete digs through one foot of the chosen tunnel; this costs him one dollar. if the tunnel is now completely clear, pete travels through the tunnel to the newly opened pocket and mines the ore. if that pocket contains the motherlode, then he stops exploring the mine. otherwise, he sells the ore in that pocket for $x_ i$ dollars and continues exploring. note that the tunnel pete chooses to dig in the first step of each round of digging does not need to be adjacent to his current location, so long as pete can reach the tunnel by traveling through the mine along a sequence of completely-excavated tunnels. he can also choose a different tunnel each round, even if the tunnel he was digging in the previous round is not yet completely excavated. if pete ends a round of digging with no money, and without having reached the motherlode, the mining operation is a bust and pete goes home bankrupt. pete has surveyed the geology of the area and knows the mine layout, as well as the amount of ore in each chamber, but hasn\\u2019t yet decided on a strategy for how to dig the tunnels. he knows that in addition to any riches he earns from the mine itself, he will need some amount of startup money in order to reach the motherlode, and so he is courting investors. he wants to present them with two pieces of information: the minimum number of dollars $a$ that pete must begin with in order for his venture to be successful even in the worst-case: for it to be guaranteed that he reaches the motherlode no matter how he chooses the tunnel to excavate during each round of digging. the minimum number of dollars $b$ that pete must begin with in order to reach the motherlode in the best-case scenario where pete chooses tunnels optimally. this information will allow the investors to decide how much to fund pete, based on how much they trust him to dig optimally without making any mistakes. given the mine layout, compute $a$ and $b$. the first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 200\\\\, 000$), the number of nodes in the tree representing pete\\u2019s mine. the remaining input consists of $n-1$ lines, the $i$th of which (starting at $1$) contains three integers $p_ i$, $x_ i$, and $y_ i$ encoding information about the $i$th node of the tree. $p_ i$ ($0 \\\\leq p_ i < i$) is the index of the $i$th node\\u2019s parent in the tree. a parent index of zero means that the node\\u2019s parent is the mine entrance (root of the tree). $x_ i$ is the value of the ore in node $i$, and $y_ i$ ($1 \\\\leq y_ i \\\\leq 1\\\\, 000$) is the length of the tunnel connecting node $p_ i$ to node $i$. exactly one node has $x_ i= -1$, indicating that the node contains the motherlode;

y)$. then follow $f$ lines with ice floe descriptions. an ice floe is described as a polygon. every floe line consists of the number of vertices $(3 \\\\leq v \\\\leq 100)$ followed by $v$ coordinates, also on the form $(x\\\\; y)$. the coordinates might be given in clockwise or counterclockwise order. for each test case, output the surface area of the smallest ice floe any of the scientists need to pass in order for them to meet, provided that they have chosen the safest possible route. if no possible route exists, output \\u201cscientists cannot meet\\u201d. the output for each test case should be on a line by itself. https://open.kattis.com/problems/icefloes\",\n          \"ball tricks rb is a basketball coach and he has several teams of exceptionally skilled basketball players, who dominate basketball leagues all over the world. why are rb\\u2019s players so good? the reason is that each of them has already mastered exactly one ball trick \\u2013 either the triple spin, or the power charge. for convenience, we call the former trick 1 and the latter trick 2. these two tricks are extremely effective in attack. besides mastering such powerful trick, each of them also knows how to defend against exactly one ball trick. therefore, one of their popular training routines is to let two players play against each other, one using a trick and the other trying to defend against it. we call this a move. the one who uses a trick is called an attacker, and the other is called a defender. rb\\u2019s team can perform sequences of moves. to state it more concisely, we use the notation $(\\\\text {attacker}, \\\\text {defender})$ to represent a move. suppose the current move is $(\\\\texttt{a}, \\\\texttt{b})$. a performs the only trick he knows. if a attacks successfully (i.e., b fails to defend), the next move will normally be $(\\\\texttt{a}, \\\\texttt{c})$ for some other player c. however, if it is the third consecutive time a attacks successfully, a will have to take a rest for the next two moves and the next move will be $(\\\\texttt{c}, \\\\texttt{d})$ for some other players c and d. if a fails (i.e., b defends successfully), the next move will be $(\\\\texttt{b}, \\\\texttt{c})$ for some other player c. note that in all cases, a, b, c, and d must be pairwise distinct players. in addition, c and d must not be at rest for the next move. today, rb inspects the team training. he is interested in sequences of moves of length exactly $n$. how many different sequences of moves of length $n$ are there? two sequences of moves and are considered different if and only if for some $i$, $\\\\mathrm{atk}_ i \\\\neq \\\\mathrm{atk}_ i^{'}$ or $\\\\mathrm{def}_ i \\\\neq \\\\mathrm{def}_ i^{'}$. since the number may be too large, output it modulo $1\\\\, 000\\\\, 000\\\\, 007$ ($10^9 + 7$). the first and only line of input consists of five non-negative integers, $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, $a_{21}$, $a_{22}$, and $n$. $a_{ij}$ denotes the number of players in rb\\u2019s team who knows how to perform skill $i$ and how to defend against skill $j$. output the number of length-$n$ sequences of moves, modulo $1\\\\, 000\\\\, 000\\\\, 007$. https://open.kattis.com/problems/balltricks\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

(a) the original fiber network. (b) one possible solution. the number of links has changed for three nodes: $1$, $2$, and $5$. the input begins with a line containing two integers $n$ ($2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^4$) and $m$ ($1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10^5$), denoting the number of nodes and the number of fiber links in the existing network. the nodes are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$. each of the next $m$ lines contains two distinct integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$, denoting the fact that the $i^{\\\\text {th}}$ fiber link connects nodes numbered $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. it is guaranteed that for each pair of nodes there exists at least one path connecting the two nodes. any pair of nodes may have more than one fiber link connecting them. display the smallest number of nodes for which the number of connected links needs to change. starting on the next line, display a system of connections in the same format as the input. that is, display a line containing the number of nodes (this will be the same as in the input) and the number of wireless links, and then on subsequent lines descriptions of the links. if more than one layout is possible, any valid layout will be accepted. https://open.kattis.com/problems/newfiber\",\n          \"two knights' poem two chess knights have decided to collaborate on writing short, one-line poems. they have obtained the use of a laptop to type their poetry. the laptop keyboard is composed of 4 rows of 10 keys. 30 of these are symbol keys, 4 are shift keys, and 6 are space keys. note that the shift and space keys, which are usually extra-wide keys on a keyboard, are treated here as multiple individual keys that each have the same effect. the knights will type the poem by making moves, one at a time, that are valid for a chess knight. a chess knight can move two positions vertically and then one horizontally, or one position vertically and then two horizontally. for example, from the d key, a knight can move to any of these keys: q, z, t, b, the second shift key from the left, and the second space key from the left. one knight always begins each poem on the left-most shift key. the other knight always begins on the right-most shift key. either knight may move first, and either may make multiple consecutive moves. the knights cannot occupy the same key. each move of a knight will type at most one character, adding to the poem. landing on a symbol key or space key will type one character. a knight landing on a symbol key types the upper value of that key when the other knight is on a shift key; otherwise, the lower value is typed. landing on a space key always types a single space character, regardless of whether the other knight is on a shift key. landing on a shift key does not add anything to the poem. there will be up to 10 test cases in the input. each test case will consist of a string on a single line, representing a poem. each poem will consist of 1 to 100 characters inclusive, using only characters from the symbol keys on the keyboard and spaces. no poem will begin or end with a space. the input will end with a line with a single asterisk (\\u2019*\\u2019). for each poem, output 1 if the knights can type the poem, or 0 if they cannot. https://open.kattis.com/problems/twoknights\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 680,\n        \"min\": 500,\n        \"max\": 6692,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1920,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1151,\n          889,\n          3478\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 121,\n        \"min\": 76,\n        \"max\": 1227,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 557,\n        \"samples\": [\n          271,\n          505,\n          307\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"symbol_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 4,\n        \"max\": 123,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 37,\n        \"samples\": [\n          15,\n          14,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keyword_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          13,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

(a) the original fiber network. (b) one possible solution. the number of links has changed for three nodes: $1$, $2$, and $5$. the input begins with a line containing two integers $n$ ($2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^4$) and $m$ ($1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10^5$), denoting the number of nodes and the number of fiber links in the existing network. the nodes are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$. each of the next $m$ lines contains two distinct integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$, denoting the fact that the $i^{\\\\text {th}}$ fiber link connects nodes numbered $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. it is guaranteed that for each pair of nodes there exists at least one path connecting the two nodes. any pair of nodes may have more than one fiber link connecting them. display the smallest number of nodes for which the number of connected links needs to change. starting on the next line, display a system of connections in the same format as the input. that is, display a line containing the number of nodes (this will be the same as in the input) and the number of wireless links, and then on subsequent lines descriptions of the links. if more than one layout is possible, any valid layout will be accepted. https://open.kattis.com/problems/newfiber\",\n          \"two knights' poem two chess knights have decided to collaborate on writing short, one-line poems. they have obtained the use of a laptop to type their poetry. the laptop keyboard is composed of 4 rows of 10 keys. 30 of these are symbol keys, 4 are shift keys, and 6 are space keys. note that the shift and space keys, which are usually extra-wide keys on a keyboard, are treated here as multiple individual keys that each have the same effect. the knights will type the poem by making moves, one at a time, that are valid for a chess knight. a chess knight can move two positions vertically and then one horizontally, or one position vertically and then two horizontally. for example, from the d key, a knight can move to any of these keys: q, z, t, b, the second shift key from the left, and the second space key from the left. one knight always begins each poem on the left-most shift key. the other knight always begins on the right-most shift key. either knight may move first, and either may make multiple consecutive moves. the knights cannot occupy the same key. each move of a knight will type at most one character, adding to the poem. landing on a symbol key or space key will type one character. a knight landing on a symbol key types the upper value of that key when the other knight is on a shift key; otherwise, the lower value is typed. landing on a space key always types a single space character, regardless of whether the other knight is on a shift key. landing on a shift key does not add anything to the poem. there will be up to 10 test cases in the input. each test case will consist of a string on a single line, representing a poem. each poem will consist of 1 to 100 characters inclusive, using only characters from the symbol keys on the keyboard and spaces. no poem will begin or end with a space. the input will end with a line with a single asterisk (\\u2019*\\u2019). for each poem, output 1 if the knights can type the poem, or 0 if they cannot. https://open.kattis.com/problems/twoknights\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 680,\n        \"min\": 500,\n        \"max\": 6692,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1920,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1151,\n          889,\n          3478\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 121,\n        \"min\": 76,\n        \"max\": 1227,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 557,\n        \"samples\": [\n          271,\n          505,\n          307\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"symbol_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 4,\n        \"max\": 123,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 37,\n        \"samples\": [\n          15,\n          14,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keyword_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          13,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
